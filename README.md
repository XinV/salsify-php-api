salsify-php-api
===============

_NOTE: this is very incomplete! As of now it's only real feature is to be able to start a channel export and then download and parse its data._

Example API that deals with the [Salsify REST channel API](http://help.salsify.com/knowledge_base/topics/channel-exports) and [Salsify JSON format](http://help.salsify.com/knowledge_base/topics/salsify-json-import-format).

This uses the [JSON streaming parser](https://github.com/salsify/jsonstreamingparser) under the hood.
